# FluffyChatBot

Post on my site: https://www.maguro.one/2020/01/fluffy-chatbot.html

Custom twitch bot that identifies StarCraft II Co-op mutators and posts them in the chat. And with added support for intergration into my [MM] maps. You can affect the game with several supported commands (!message, !spawn, !mutator, !join, !resources)

Use it mainly for reference, mutator identification would need to be modified to work at different resolutions and screen aspect ratios.

I added a lightweight version that contains configurable commands and responses to them, together with integration to [MM] maps. Image recognition requires packages that would push the compiled size to around ~300MB.
