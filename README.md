# FluffyChatBot
Custom twitch bot that identifies StarCraft II Co-op mutators and posts them in the chat.

Added support for intergration into my [MM] maps. You can affect the game with several supported commands (!message, !spawn, !mutator, !join, !resources)

Use it for reference, it needs to be modified for it to work at different resolutions and screen aspect ratios.
